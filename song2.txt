I'm not easy buddy
Who the fuck is easy now?
Anyway we'll puzzle out
What is this all for

Same shit old stuff
Changes of life is never enough
People are changing and maybe not in vain
But I think I am all the same
Everyone's right, however not me
Every man has his own reality
And me time after time
Don't hit the bull's eye
